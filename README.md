# Grayshade
I personally felt the need of a platform where people can say anything to anyone without disclosing their identity .
A platform where an employee can point out things to his boss ,a student can say anything to his teacher without the fear of its after effect.

Grayshade is an anonymous social platform where :

1.Every person is having his/her profile with a real-name and an anonymous name.

2. You can search your  friends , family members and known people with their real name and send messages to them with your anonymous name.

3. You can create group of your known people and can send message to the group without letting other members of the group to know who has send the message.
